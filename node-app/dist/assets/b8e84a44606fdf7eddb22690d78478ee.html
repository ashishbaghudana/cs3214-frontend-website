        <ul>
            <li>To find a partner, talk to your class mates.
                <!--   Commented out for Fall 2018 as Piazza is not used for this semester (should we direct them to post in forum?)-->
                <!-- You may use the Piazza <a ng-href="{{course.teamadurl}}">Search for Teammates</a> feature as well. -->
            </li>
            <li>You may team up across sections.</li>
            <li>Below, we show you a list of all students who are currently enrolled in CS 3214
                along with their team status. To help direct you when looking for partners, and to
                provide us with feedback about how many teams have been formed, we ask that you
                select your partner from the list below; this will remove you and your partner from
                the pool of available students.
            </li>
            <li>Note, however, that this app is only intended as help for finding a partner.
                We will not use it for grading to determine group membership.
                Each project has specific instructions on how to list the team members
                in the submission.

                You chose yourselves as a partner. We generally discourage this, and ask
                that you contact your instructor to discuss this further.
